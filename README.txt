Info on TFAV

TFAV is a very basic .bat and .vbs fork bomb. It does not deal damage to computers, and is only a prank "virus".

TFAV is meant to be put onto a USB drive that can hold under 10kb of storage (the whole thing is 8kb), that can be put into a computer.

TFAV is only meant for Windows. It is not compatible with Apple, Linux or any other software, as I designed it on Windows only.

IMPORTANT: TFAV will only run correctly if ran from the TFAV shortcut.

TFAV can be closed easily. There are a set of instructions below.

With USB:

1. Take out the USB with TFAV located inside.
2. Right click on the .vbs files and close them.
(Incase of errors) 3. Error popups MIGHT open. Right click them and close them.
4. Right click on the .bat files and close them.

Without USB:

1. Press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys on your keyboard.
2. At the bottom right, right click the power icon.
3. Restart your PC/Laptop.

I am afraid there isn't a way to contact me for support or bugs.
