Info on TFAV

TFAV is a very basic .bat and .vbs fork bomb. It does not deal major damage to any computers, and is only meant to be served as a prank.

TFAV can be very easily put onto a USB drive that can hold under 10kb of storage (the whole thing is 10kb), and can be put into a computer.

TFAV is only meant for Windows. It is not compatible with Apple, Linux or any other software (such as raspberry pi) I designed it on windows only.

It is meant for USB's but can be used without USB's. Please only open TFAV from the TFAV shortcut.

TFAV is very easy to close. Here is a set of instructions.

With USB:

1. Take out the USB.
2. Right click on the .vbs files and close them.
(Incase of errors) 3. Alot of error popups MIGHT open. Right click them and close them
4. Right click on the .bat files and close them.

Without USB:

1. Restart your PC/Laptop.

I am afraid you cannot contact me for any support, as I do not have any social medias.
Thanks for using TFAV.
